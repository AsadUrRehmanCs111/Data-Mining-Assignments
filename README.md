# Data Mining Assignment Questions

## Q1: What is data mining and what are different sources of data in modern world?

### Data Mining:
As mining in Data Mining suggests extracting something valuable.
Data Mining is a process of discovering patterns in larger data sets. it is a process of finding anomalies, patterns, and correlations within large datasets to predict outcomes.
In short, we can say, data mining is a process used to extract usable data from larger sets of raw data.
**Following are some sources of data in the modern world:**

Because in Data Mining we need implicit knowledge. But in DMBS we don't need any implicit knowledge get extract or get data. AS we Know, DBMS is an organized collection of data where we write a query for required data and get the information that we want which is called raw data. On the other hand, Data Mining analyzes data from different information to discover usable information and previously unknown information from raw data.

2. Median
3. Mode

## Q24: Differentiate between symmetric and skewed data?

### Differentiate between symmetric and skewed data:
### Symmetric data:
 Symmetric data that has an equal no of data points on either side or equally distributed.
### Skewed or Asymmetric data:
 Asymmetric data is data that is differ from a normal or gaussian distribution.This may be positively skewed data or negatively skewed data.

1. Positively Skewed data:
 Having concentrated data on the right side of the middle data point.
2. Negatively Skewed Data: 
 Having concentrated data on the left side of the middle point of distribution.

## Q25: What is dispersion of data?

### Dispersion of data:
 The measure of the extent to which individual items vary. also called how much data is spread or scattered. It indicates the consistency of data. When the data set has a large value it has large scattered values and when the data set has a small set of values it has small scattering values. It is used to measure the variability of data used in data mining.

## Q26: Define Box Plot Analytics?

### Box plot:
 Boxplots are the visual representation of quartiles. If we want to see the graphical forms of data quartiles it would be in the form of Boxplots. Boxplot is a standard way of displaying data based on a five-number summary. The end of the box is at the 1st and 3rd quartile and the median is within the box.

## Q27: What are Five Number Summary of Box Plot?

### Five Number Summary of Box Plot:
A boxplot displays the five-number summary of a set of data.
**The five-number summary is:**

1. Minimum
2. 1st quartile (Q1)
3. Median
4. 3rd quartile (Q3)
5. Maximum

## Q28: What are Whiskers and Out liners?

### Whiskers:
 Two lines outside the box extended to Min & Max.

### Outliers:

 Points beyond a specified outlier threshold plotted individually or Outliers may be plotted as individual points.

## Q29: what are histograms?

### Histograms:
 The histogram is a measure of the graphical display of tabulated values/frequencies. No of the data items in intervals are Frequencies. And bar height describes the occurrence of the data items.

## Q30: Difference between Bar Chart & Histogram?

### Difference between Bar Chart & Histogram

### Bar Chart:
1. Barcharts may have gaps mean they may not be continuous.
2. Barcharts are used for categorical data.

### Histogram:
1. Histograms are always continued and defined for every data point.
2. Histograms are used for nominal data.

## Q31: Types of Histogram?
### Types of Histogram:
**The following are the types of Histogram:**

### 1. Bell Shaped:
The Normal Distribution. In this type, the points on one side of the middle are as likely to occur as on the other side of the middle. 

### 2. Doubled Peaked:
Suggests two Distributions Also Known as a bimodal distribution. It has two peaks. In this type, the data should be separated and analyzed as separate normal distributions. 

### 3. Skewed:
Look for Other Processes in the Tail. It may be left-skewed or right-skewed.

### 4. Truncated: 
Looks For reasons for the sharp end of distribution or pattern.

### 5. Ragged Plateau: 
No Single clear process or pattern. Also known as random distribution. It lacks an apparent pattern and has several peaks. It can be the case that different data properties were combined. Therefore, the data should be separated and analyzed separately.

## Q32: Define Quantile- Quantile Plots?

### Quantile- Quantile Plots:
The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot is a graphical technique for evaluating if two sets of data come from widely disseminated populations. Or A quantile-quantile plot is a probability plot in statistics and is a graphical way to compare two probability distributions by plotting their quantities against each other. 

## Q33: what is scatter Plot?

### Scatter Plot

A scatter plot is a type of plot which is used to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.
E.g Graph between height and weight.

+ **Correlation:** It means How two data values are related to each other. The variables may be Positively (directly) related or Negatively (inversely) related.
+ **Clusters of points:** We check data where two points having clusters. 

## Q34: what is geometric visualization?

### Geometric visualization:
In Geometric visualization, we focus on the iransformation of data and projection of data. It means that how data is transformed from one domain to another domain and what is the projection of that data.


## Q35: what is icon-based visualization?

### Icon-based visualization:
Icon Based visualization uses small icons to represents multi-dimension data values.

### Typical visualization methods

+ Chernoff Faces
+ Stick Figures
### General Techniques:

#### 1. Shape coding: 
This technique, uses shapes to represent certain information encoding
#### 2. Color icons:
This technique, uses color icons to encode more information
#### 3. Tile bars: 
This technique, uses  small icons to represent the relevant feature vectors in document retrieval

## Q36: what is Chernoff faces?

### Chernoff faces:
Represent variables in 2-dimension space. Chernoff faces, invented in 1973 by Herman Chernoff, show the form of a human face with multivariate details. The individual pieces, such as the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, by their form, size, location, and orientation, represent the values of the variables. The concept behind using faces is that, without trouble, people quickly identify faces and note slight changes. The Chernoff faces treat each variable differently. Since the characteristics of the faces differ in perceived significance, it is important to carefully select the way in which variables are mapped to the characteristics.

## Q37: what is Hierarchical Visualization?

### Hierarchical Visualization:
It is the representation of data in the form of hierarchy like in the tree form. If you are looking to view clusters of information, particularly if they flow from a single origin point, hierarchical visualizations are best suited. The downside to these diagrams is that they appear to be more complicated and hard to understand, which is why the tree diagram is most commonly used. It is the simplest to follow due to its linear path.

### Examples of hierarchical data visualizations include:

1. Tree diagrams
2. Ring charts
3. Sunburst diagrams

## Q38: what is Dimensional Stacking?

### Dimensional Stacking:
In Dimensional Staking the word Stack or Stacking means to place one thing to another thing. So we can easily say that Dimensional Stacking is about placing dimension to another dimension.

### Proper Definition: 
Dimensional Stacking is a technique for displaying multivariate data in two-dimensional screen space. This technique involves the discretization and recursive embedding of dimensions, each resulting N-dimensional bin occupying a unique position on the screen.

+ Important Attributes are kept on an outer level.

## Q39: what is Tree Mapping in hierarchical visualization?

### Tree Mapping:
In Tree mapping, we generate data in the form of rectangles. Its simple idea is just like a tree in which we do screen Filling like we have a rectangular box and we keep placing small rectangles in it. The small rectangle means that we will see the root node then their child node and so on.

### Proper Definition:
Treemaps are visualizations for hierarchical data. They are made of a series of nested rectangles of sizes proportional to the corresponding data value. A large rectangle represents a branch of a data tree, and it is subdivided into smaller rectangles that represent the size of each node within that branch.
